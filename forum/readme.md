<!-- 1 -->

The subject of the dissertation is of particular interest in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the growing needs of manufacturing enterprises for integrated, adaptive and scalable solutions for managing customer orders. The doctoral student has identified specific challenges facing enterprises, such as the need for rapid processing of large volumes of data, integration between existing ERP and SCM systems, and the need for adaptation to dynamically changing customer requirements. The dissertation proposes solutions to these issues by applying contemporary technologies- domain design, CQRS, cloud architectures and microservices- to construct a personalised cloud information system.It is imperative to acknowledge the author's comprehensive approach, which encompasses a meticulous integration of theoretical analysis and modelling, culminating in the practical implementation and rigorous testing of the system within a tangible real-world environment.

The Introduction justifies the need for digitalization of business processes in manufacturingenterprises using cloud technologies. The author notes that traditional ERP and SCM systems often do not fully cover the needs of modern supply chains, especially when flexibility, scalability and integration are needed. The main research thesis is that through a personalized cloud system, built using IaaS, PaaS and SaaS models and tailored to the specific needs of a given enterprise, it is possible to significantly improve order management, logistics activities and interaction with business customers.

<!-- 2 -->

The object of the study is the processes in the supply chain of a manufacturing enterprise, while the subject of the study is the methods for rationalization and automation of business processes through cloud platforms and modern architectural solutions. Scientific methods such as modeling, comparative and logical analysis, a systems approach and approbation through A/B testing were used.

# 3. General characteristics of the dissertation, assessment of the structure and content

The initial chapter undertakes an examination of the primary theoretical aspects of ERP systems, domain design, cloud architectures and models such as CQRS and Event Sourcing. The text presents critical analyses and comparisons between different approaches and technologies. The second chapter delineates the architecture of the proposed system through a conceptual, logical and communication model. The models are presented visually and reasonably.The third chapter is dedicated to the practical implementation of the system in a real environment, namely the enterprise "Heidelberg Cement Devnya" AD. The document provides detailed information on the selection of technologies, their implementation, testing and monitoring.

The testing of the developed system in the real production environment of "Heidelberg Cement Devnya" AD represents a significant advantage of the work. The employment of an A/B testing strategy, categorised by roles (business client and supplier), serves to illustrate the practical efficacy and readiness of the system for utilisation in a real-world context. The system is designed to simulate a variety of scenarios, including the creation and modification of orders, real-time monitoring, the utilisation of IoT sensors, and the signing of electronic documents. A quantitative analysis was conducted using data from the SAP ERP subsystem, which demonstrates not only technological integration, but also accountability and control.

<!-- 3 -->

The selection of technologies employed - namely, ASP.NET Core,Azure, Cosmos DB, .NET MAUI, Blazor and RabbitMQ- is substantiated and aligned with the objectives of the project. The provision of high performance, scalability and security is guaranteed. The incorporation of a microservice architecture, in conjunction with the application of the CAP theorem (Brewer's theorem), is indicative of a profound level of analysis and technological sophistication. The built model incorporates communication between the user interface, microservices and ERP/SCM subsystems, utilising REST and gRPC. The system incorporates a CI/CD strategy that utilises Docker and GitHub Actions,thereby ensuring a high level of automation and compatibility with DevOps practices.

# 4. Identification and evaluation of scientific and applied scientific contributions in the dissertation work

In theoretical terms, a comprehensive conceptual framework and technological model for a personalised customer order management system using cloud technologies have been developed. Conceptual, logical and communication models have been built using principles such as DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing. In applied terms, a selection of technologies has been justified, and testing has been conducted through A/B tests in a real environment. A phased implementation plan has also been proposed.

It is hypothesised that the contributions are significant and justified. It is predicted that the proposed system,if implemented,will be capable of efficiency, adaptability and a high degree of automation.
