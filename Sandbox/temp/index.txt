ICT technologies are used all over the world. 
They cover any product that manipulates information electronically in a digital format.
These products assist us in dealing with the dynamic everyday life.
Every year, billions of dollars are spent on IT
to improve educational processes, science, health care, and many other areas.
The impact on economics and business is huge.

I met AI back in 2017 when I was introduced to cloud cognitive services and their cool products.
I implemented a chatbot that helps me with students' preparation during our university exercises.
That small project aims to educate the students and also collect and aggregate the input data.
